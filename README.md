# Hate-Speech-and-Offensive-Language-Detection

###• Conducted a comparative study on hate speech detection using supervised ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, XGBoost) and a ###deep learning LSTM model.
###• Developed a real-time detection system with a Streamlit interface, showcasing XGBoost for efficiency and LSTM for
###sequence-aware classification.
